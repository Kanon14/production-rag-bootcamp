Topic: GraphRAG Introduction

Traditional RAG struggles with multi-hop reasoning:
Q: "Which employees work in the same department as the CEO's assistant?"
- Need to find: CEO → CEO's assistant → their department → other employees
- Vector similarity can't traverse these relationships

GraphRAG builds a knowledge graph from documents, enabling:
- Multi-hop reasoning across entities
- Relationship-based retrieval
- Global summarization of topics

This lesson introduces the concepts. For full implementation,
see Microsoft's GraphRAG library or LangGraph's graph-based retrieval.

    OPTION 1: Microsoft GraphRAG (Recommended for Full Implementation)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ```bash
    pip install graphrag

    # Index documents
    graphrag index --root ./my_docs

    # Query
    graphrag query --method local "Who works with the CEO?"
    graphrag query --method global "What are the main themes?"
    ```
    Pros: Full-featured, well-documented, production-ready
    Cons: Heavy, requires significant compute for indexing


    OPTION 2: LangGraph + Neo4j (Custom Implementation)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ```python
    from langchain_community.graphs import Neo4jGraph
    from langchain.chains import GraphCypherQAChain

    graph = Neo4jGraph(url="bolt://localhost:7687")

    chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm(
        llm=ChatOpenAI(),
        graph=graph,
        verbose=True
    )
    result = chain.invoke("Who reports to the CEO?")
    ```
    Pros: Full control, integrates with existing Neo4j
    Cons: Need to manage Neo4j, manual entity extraction


    OPTION 3: LlamaIndex Knowledge Graph Index
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ```python
    from llama_index.core import KnowledgeGraphIndex

    kg_index = KnowledgeGraphIndex.from_documents(
        documents,
        max_triplets_per_chunk=10,
        include_embeddings=True
    )
    query_engine = kg_index.as_query_engine()
    response = query_engine.query("Who works in Engineering?")
    ```
    Pros: Easy to use, good LlamaIndex integration
    Cons: Less powerful than full GraphRAG


    OPTION 4: Hybrid - Vector + Graph
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Combine traditional RAG with graph traversal:

    1. Vector search to find relevant documents
    2. Extract entities from retrieved docs
    3. Graph traversal for multi-hop reasoning
    4. LLM synthesizes final answer

    Pros: Best of both worlds
    Cons: More complex to implement


    WHEN TO USE GRAPHRAG:
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ✅ Documents describe relationships (org charts, research papers)
    ✅ Queries need multi-hop reasoning
    ✅ "Who/what is connected to X?" type questions
    ✅ Need global summarization across documents

    ❌ Simple fact retrieval (use standard RAG)
    ❌ Small document sets (<100 docs)
    ❌ Real-time indexing requirements
    ❌ Cost-sensitive applications (indexing is expensive)
